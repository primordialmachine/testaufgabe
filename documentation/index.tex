\chapter{Library Interface Documentation}

\section{\texttt{namespace primordialmachine}}
The namespace this library is adding its declarations/definitions to.
The added namespace elements are documented below.

\subsection{\texttt{saturated} (\texttt{struct})}

\input{Isa}

\subsection{Color space types}
The library provides \texttt{struct} types each one denoting a color space.
Table \ref{table:color-space-types} denotes the type in the left column and the color space the type is denoting in the right column.

    \newcolumntype{L}{>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}X}

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|>{\hsize=0.175\hsize}L|>{\hsize=0.825\hsize}L|}
\hline
\texttt{color\_space\_rgb}  & RGB color space with three components for red, green, and blue.\\
\hline
\texttt{color\_space\_rgba} & RGBA color space with four components for red, green, blue, and alpha.\\
\hline
\texttt{color\_space\_l}    & L color space with one component for luminance.\\
\hline
\texttt{color\_space\_la}   & LA color space with two components for luminance and alpha.\\
\hline
\texttt{color\_space\_hsv}  & HSV color space with three components for hue, saturation, and value.\\
\hline
\texttt{color\_space\_hsva} & HSVA color space with four components for hue, saturation, value, and alpha.\\
\hline
\texttt{color\_space\_hsl}  & HSL color space with three components for hue, saturation, and lightness.\\
\hline
\texttt{color\_space\_hsla} & HSLA color space with four components for hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha.\\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Color space types.}
\label{table:color-space-types}
\end{table}
\Isa{color\_space}

\subsubsection{Component arithmetic types}
The library provides \texttt{struct} types each one denoting a component arithmetic.
Table \ref{table:component-arithmetic-types} denotes the type in the left column and the component arithmetic the type is denoting in the right column.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|>{\hsize=0.325\hsize}L|>{\hsize=0.675\hsize}L|}
\hline
\texttt{component\_arithmetic\_saturated} & Saturated component arithmetic.\newline An alias of \texttt{component\_arithmetic\_clamped}.\\
\hline
\texttt{component\_arithmetic\_clamped}   & Clamped component arithmetic. \newline An alias of \texttt{component\_arithmetic\_saturated}.\\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Component arithmetic types.}
\label{table:component-arithmetic-types}
\end{table}
\Isa{component\_arithmetic}

\subsection{\texttt{color} (struct type)}
A \texttt{struct} template struct with four template parameters \texttt{COMPONENT},
\texttt{COMPONENT\_ARITHMETIC}, \texttt{COLOR\_SPACE}, and \texttt{ENABLED}. The
default value is \texttt{void}. Speializations of this template may use \texttt{ENABLED}
to perform SFINAE.\newline

A possible implementation is given by\newline
\texttt{template\textlangle typename COMPONENT, typename COMPONENT\_ARITHMETIC, typename COLOR\_SPACE\textrangle\newline
struct color;}\newline

\hline
\texttt{COMPONENT}                                           & \texttt{COMPONENT\_ARITHMETIC}                                                          & \texttt{COLOR\_SPACE}\\
