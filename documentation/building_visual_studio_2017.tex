\chapter{Building under Visual Studio 2017}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Open the solution \texttt{solution.sln} in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.
\item Batch build everything.
\item The folder \texttt{packages} contains the distribution of the library i.e. include files and the
      static libraries for
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item the platform targets \texttt{x86} and \texttt{x64} and
    \item configurations \texttt{Release} and \texttt{Debug}.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Copy the contents of the \verb+packages+ folder into a directory. Let
      \verb+[library home]+ be a placeholder denoting the path by which that folder
      can be referenced from your project.
\item Add
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item the include path
\texttt{[library home]/\GetLibraryIncludesDirectoryPath}
	and
    \item the library path
\texttt{[library home]/\GetLibraryStaticLibrariesDirectoryPath}
    to your project.
\end{enumerate}
\item Link your project with the library \texttt{\GetLibraryStaticLibraryFileName}.
\item Add the include directive \texttt{\#include "{}\GetLibraryIncludeDirectiveFilePath"{}} where appropriate.
\item You can now use the functionality provided by the library.
\end{enumerate}
